## Overview
The Answer Grading System is a web application built using Flask that automates the grading of answers from PDF files. It utilizes semantic analysis with BERT for comparing student answers to a provided answer key. This project aims to streamline the grading process, offering educators a tool to quickly and objectively assess responses.

## Features
- **Automatic Grading**: Upload PDF files containing questions, answer keys, and student responses to automatically generate grades.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Uses BERT-based semantic similarity to compare answers for more accurate grading.
- **Grade Calculation**: Grades are calculated based on similarity scores between student answers and correct answers.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple web interface built with Flask, HTML, and CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind) for easy navigation and use.
